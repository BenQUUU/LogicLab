# LogicLab - digital circuit simulator

The application is designed to allow the user to model, visualize, and analyze the operation of logic circuits. This project also responds to the need to facilitate learning and better understand the basic concepts related to digital circuits. The application is dedicated to people learning the basics of digital circuit design, but it can also be used by advanced users in the process of designing digital circuits.

# Installation

The application has been compiled currently only for the x86 platform with Windows. To run the program, download the packed project from the ``Releases`` section and then, after unpacking, run the LogicLab.exe file. To use the application on other platforms, you must first build the project. To do this, you must install the Qt library in at least version 6.7.2 and then use the qmake tool.
